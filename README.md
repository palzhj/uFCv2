# u4FC - MicroTCA.4 fast control board
The uFC is a double-width Advanced Mezzanine Card (AMC) conceived to serve a small and simple system residing either inside a MicroTCA crate or on a bench with a link to a PC and it is based on a high-performance Kintex UltraScale plus FPGA. The uFC I/O capability can be further enhanced with two FPGA Mezzanine Cards (FMCs) with the high-pin-count FMC sockets. Each provide up to 8 GTY/GTH transceivers and 23 user-specific differential I/O pairs directly connected to the FPGA as well as differential clock input/outputs. Concerning the AMC high speed serial connectivity, the uFC provides two Gigabit Ethernet (GbE) and one 4nd generation four-lane PCI Express (PCIe x8 GEN4) interfaces. The uFC offers a large selection of input clock sources (AMC clocks, FMC clocks, front panel clock connector or on-board oscillators).
