# uFC - MicroTCA fast control board
The uFC is a double-width Advanced Mezzanine Card (AMC) conceived to serve a small and simple system residing either inside a MicroTCA crate or on a bench with a link to a PC and it is based on a high-performance Kintex FPGA. The uFC can interface with two SFP+ transceiver modules, each operating at bi-directional data rates of up to 10Gbps. The uFC I/O capability can be further enhanced with two FPGA Mezzanine Cards (FMCs).The two high-pin-count FMC sockets each provide up to 58 user-specific differential I/O pairs directly connected to the FPGA as well as two differential clock inputs and two differential clock outputs. Concerning the AMC high speed serial connectivity, the uFC provides two Gigabit Ethernet (GbE) and one 2nd generation four-lane PCI Express (PCIe x4 GEN2) interfaces. The uFC offers a large selection of input clock sources (AMC clocks, FMC clocks, front panel clock connector or on-board oscillators).
